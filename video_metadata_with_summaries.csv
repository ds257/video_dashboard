En fait, c'est une poudre de tabac humide à sucé qui est contenue dans des petits sachets blancs. A l'origine, c'était un mélange de tabac, d'eau, de sel, de carbonat de sodium et d'aromes cuis à la vapeur. Si le snuss est notamment très populaire en suède, il est illégal en France, même si il est très facile de s'en procurer sur des sites en ligne. Fortement doser en nicotine, le produit augmente les risques de cancer et il attaque les gensives. En octobre 2021, le coach Lee Johnson alerté sur la propagation du phénomène snuss dans le football. En effet, de nombreux joueurs seraient des consommateurs réguliers, il y a quelques années, des images des footballeurs de l'atanie bribes ou Jamie Vardy en train de prendre du snuss, ont circulé sur les réseaux. Et avec cette photo publiée, il y a quelques jours, les internautes soupçonnent l'attaquin des bleus marcus turames de consommé du snuss.","What is the SNUS?It is a small sachet of tobacco that some athletes love.In fact, it is a humid tobacco powder in Sucé which is contained in small white sachets.Originally, it was a mixture of tobacco, water, salt, sodium carbonate and steam kitchen aromas.If the SNUS is notably very popular in Sweden, it is illegal in France, even if it is very easy to get it on online sites.Highly dose in nicotine, the product increases the risk of cancer and it attacks the pensives.In October 2021, coach Lee Johnson alerted to the propagation of the SNUS phenomenon in football.Indeed, many players would be regular consumers, a few years ago, images of the footballers of the Atanie Scrubes or Jamie Vardy taking SNUS, circulated on the networks.And with this photo published a few days ago, Internet users suspect the Bleus Turames Bleus Attack from SNUS.","The TikTok video discusses snus, a sachet of moist tobacco popular with some athletes, especially in Sweden, though illegal in France.  It highlights concerns about nicotine addiction and cancer risk, referencing coach Lee Johnson's warning about snus use in football, and showing images of players like Jamie Vardy allegedly using it. The video also speculates about recent online photos suggesting French footballer Marcus Thuram might be using snus as well."

Så han kom på i som bynter snuselene og noen etter opp, så snuselte jeg tre uker sluttet at dreitlet.

Et toi, tu connais le Snuss, tu savais que c'était mauvais pour la santé ?","This is the thing of the moment, however it is not dangerous.The SNUS is everywhere in school lessons, but also in the football changing rooms.French player Marcus Durham was seen in a story with what seems to be a box of SNUS.Basically, two bases are small sachets of Tabas Saces which are stalled between the agentive and the lips.It has existed for a long time and with us, as everywhere in the European Union, it is prohibited, except in Sweden, Orvege and Switzerland.Suddenly, to get around the ban, the SNUS is sold without Tabas, but with anico-tin and which says nicotine necessarily says risk of addiction, even without tabas.Tobaccoologists worried to see that it is the kits that are targeted with colored boxes and tastes like strawberries or pignacolada that are sold on networks and in certain ketchups.And you, you know the SNUS, you knew it was bad for health?","The TikTok video discusses the rising popularity of SNUS, a nicotine pouch similar to chewing tobacco, among youth, particularly in schools and sports.  While banned in most of the EU, SNUS is readily available without tobacco but still contains addictive nicotine.  The video highlights concerns about its marketing with colorful packaging and appealing flavors like strawberry and piña colada, targeting young people.  It also questions viewers' awareness of SNUS and its health risks."

Mais le snus, c'est quoi ? C'est du tabac à succer sous forme de poudre qui se place entre la gensive et la lèvre supérieure. Il est initialement consommé dans les pays nordiques. Si on en parle aujourd'hui, c'est parce que ce tabac fait sensation chez les sportifs. Dernière exemple en date, c'est celui de l'attaquant des bleus, Marcus Turham, qui, en partence pour le mondial locataire, a été aperçu sur une photo partagée par Karim Benzema, avec une boîte de snus entre les mains. Le joueur a d'ailleurs repartagé cette photo sur ses réseaux, mais en prenant le soin de cacher cette horrible boîte qu'on ne saurait voir. Ce que cette photo nous dit, c'est donc bien que le snus se répand comme une traînée de poudre dans le milieu du sport.

They deny it's smoking and also mention consuming large quantities of energy drinks, coffee, and alcohol, suggesting potential addictive behaviors or substance abuse.  The tone is somewhat rambling and unclear, but the overall sentiment seems to be one of justifying these habits despite potential health concerns.  There's no clear indication of ONP (other nasal product) use beyond the unspecified substance in the bags.  The humor, if any, is unintentional and derives from the speaker's attempt to downplay their behavior."

I've done it before, did it for about four months, and then something happened. I ended up getting back on it. It's been on its since, but I've been thinking about for a couple of weeks now. Decided I'm going to come off it. So I'm going to be sort of documenting if you can call it that, on TikTok again. Let you know the process. Just a bit of motivation for me. But yeah, that's going to be cool for you over the next couple of weeks now.",The creator announces they're quitting nicotine pouches (similar to snus) after a three-year habit. They previously quit for four months but relapsed.  They plan to document their quitting journey on TikTok for motivation and to share the process.

Men det var typ två år sedan. Så... Vi testade den idag. Ingen. Det lukte typ tankrämm eller typ så här munskely. Denna marsen droppade på drivatten, så det är det som låter i bakgränen. Bara med en sjekt. Okej, så jag vet att det är mycket snacka om politik. Och så nu, om man ser det överallt hela tiden. Så jag tänker inte snacka om det. Men jag tänker göra så här. Så vet ni vad jag står i alla fall. Och så får ni göra vad ni vill på den informationen. Nu tillbaka till snusen. Den rinner en del. Och de var inte lika... Trevlig som jag minst. Men det snakar som luktar, det smakar lite munskely. Typ. Så. Jag fick inte bara från minnena, jag vill ha. Och de var inte lika ihop som jag kom ihåg den. Så den får... 6-10. Tack och hann trullig fel.","Today it is not a first profession.We will test that ... Velo Winter Chill.And we like this it has tested.But it was kind of two years ago.So ... we tested it today.No.The smell kind of tank or type like this munic.This marsen dropped on the drive, so that's what sounds in the background.Only with a seven.Okay, so I know it's a lot of talk about politics.And so now, if you see it everywhere all the time.So I'm not going to talk about it.But I'm going to do this.So you know what I'm standing anyway.And then you can do what you want on that information.Now back to the snuff.It runs some.And they were not as ... nice as I was least.But it snakes that smells, it tastes a little mouthless.Type.So.I didn't just get from the memories, I want.And they were not as together as I remembered it.So it gets ... 6-10.Thank you and had a great mistake.","The video shows a review of Velo Winter Chill nicotine pouches (snuff).  The reviewer mentions prior usage and notes the current product seems less potent than remembered, giving it a 6/10 rating.  They briefly acknowledge the prevalence of political discussion but avoid the topic, focusing instead on the product's smell and taste, describing it as reminiscent of fuel or munitions.  The background noise is explained as a neighbor's car."

I got a couple packs and I like them at first but after I don't know week or so I really wasn't fucking with them anymore. So we're gonna be trying on citrus. What the fuck do you open this thing? There's some powder in there. I haven't really seen this with any of the nicotine pouches that supposed to happen. I don't know. It's compared to the zins. So they're a lot smaller. Well, they're not shorter at least. Might be a little fatter but... I don't taste much right now. These are so small. I think I have trouble keeping in my mouth when I shotgun them beer. So let's try it. Might have to go bottom decking for this. Got the bushlight peach. Cheers. Well that was embarrassing. I was supposed to know how to shotgun. Finish it off I guess. So it did stay in place. I don't say I'm not getting too much flavor from these. I guess I'll have to keep it in and see what happens. I don't know man at the end of the day. I think I'm still rocking with this in.","8mg on nicotine pouches. I was doing the zins, some people recommended the robes.

They note the Rogue pouches are smaller and have powder residue, then attempt (and fail) to shotgun a beer while keeping the pouch in. They find the Rogue pouches less flavorful than Zyn and ultimately decide to stick with their original brand.  The video highlights ongoing nicotine pouch use and features a humorous failed shotgun attempt."
